        <div class="fr-view u-align-center u-clearfix u-rich-text u-text u-text-2">
          <p style="text-align: justify;">
            <span class="u-custom-font" style="font-family: Poppins;">Social engineering attacks are particularly difficult to counter because they're expressly designed to play on natural human characteristics, such as curiosity, respect for authority, and the desire to help one's friends. There are a number of tips that can help detect social engineering attacks…</span>
          </p>
          <h5 style="text-align: justify;">
            <span class="u-custom-font" style="font-family: Poppins;">Check the source</span>
          </h5>
          <p style="text-align: justify;">
            <span class="u-custom-font" style="font-family: Poppins;">Take a moment to think about where the communication is coming from; don't trust it blindly. A USB stick turns up on your desk, and you don't know what it is? A phone call from out of the blue says you've inherited $5 million? An email from your CEO asking for a load of information on individual employees? All of these sound suspicious and should be treated as such.</span>
          </p>
          <p style="text-align: justify;">
            <span class="u-custom-font" style="font-family: Poppins;">Checking the source isn’t difficult. For instance, with an email, look at the email header and check against valid emails from the same sender. Look at where the links go - spoofed hyperlinks are easy to spot by simply hovering your cursor over them (do not click the link though!) Check the spelling: banks have whole teams of qualified people dedicated to producing customer communications, so an email with glaring errors is probably a fake.</span>
          </p>
          <p style="text-align: justify;">
            <span class="u-custom-font" style="font-family: Poppins;">If in doubt, go to the official website and get in contact with an official representative, as they will be able to confirm if the email/message is official or fake.</span>
          </p>
          <h5 style="text-align: justify;">
            <span class="u-custom-font" style="font-family: Poppins;">What do they know?</span>
          </h5>
          <p style="text-align: justify;">
            <span class="u-custom-font" style="font-family: Poppins;">Does the source not have information you'd expect them to have, such as your full name, etc.? Remember, if a bank is phoning you, they should have all of that data in front of them and they will always ask security questions before allowing you to make changes to your account. If they don’t, then the chances of it being a fake email/call/message are significantly higher, and you should be wary.</span>
          </p>
          <h5 style="text-align: justify;">
            <span class="u-custom-font" style="font-family: Poppins;">Break the loop</span>
          </h5>
          <p style="text-align: justify;">
            <span class="u-custom-font" style="font-family: Poppins;">Social engineering often depends on a sense of urgency. Attackers hope their targets will not think too hard about what's going on. So just taking a moment to think can deter these attacks or show them for what they are — fakes.</span>
          </p>
          <p style="text-align: justify;">
            <span class="u-custom-font" style="font-family: Poppins;">Ring the official number or go through the official website URL, rather than giving data out on the phone or clicking on a link. Use a different method of communication to check out the source's credibility. For instance, if you get an email from a friend asking you to wire money, text them on their mobile or call them to verify whether it’s really them.</span>
          </p>
          <h5 style="text-align: justify;">
            <span class="u-custom-font" style="font-family: Poppins;">Ask for ID</span>
          </h5>
          <p style="text-align: justify;">
            <span class="u-custom-font" style="font-family: Poppins;">One of the easiest social engineering attacks is bypassing security to get into a building by carrying a large box or an armful of files. After all, some helpful person will hold the door open. Don’t fall for this. Always ask for ID.</span>
          </p>
          <p style="text-align: justify;">
            <span class="u-custom-font" style="font-family: Poppins;">The same applies to other approaches. Checking the name and number of whoever is calling or asking, "Who do you report to?" should be a basic response to requests for information. Then simply check the organization’s chart or phone directory before giving out any private information or personal data. If you don’t know the individual requesting the information and still don’t feel comfortable parting with the information, tell them you need to double check with someone else, and you will come back to them</span>
          </p>

          </h1>
          <h5 id="isPasted" style="text-align: justify;">
            <span class="u-custom-font" style="font-family: Poppins;">Use a good spam filter</span>
          </h5>
          <p style="text-align: justify;">
            <span class="u-custom-font" style="font-family: Poppins;">If</span>
            <span class="u-custom-font" style="font-family: Poppins;">&nbsp;your email program isn't filtering out enough spam or marking emails as suspicious, you might want to alter the settings. Good spam filters use various kinds of information to determine which emails are likely to be spam. They might detect suspicious files or links, they may have a blacklist of suspicious IP addresses or sender IDs, or they may analyze the content of messages to determine which are likely to be fake.</span>
          </p>
          <h5 style="text-align: justify;">I<span class="u-custom-font" style="font-family: Poppins;">s this realistic?</span>
          </h5>
          <p style="text-align: justify;">
            <span class="u-custom-font" style="font-family: Poppins;">Some social engineering attacks work by trying to trick you into not being analytical and taking the time to assess whether the situation is realistic can help detect many attacks. For example:</span>
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li style="text-align: justify;">
              <span class="u-custom-font" style="font-family: Poppins;">If your friend was really stuck in China with no way out, would they send you an email or would they ring you/ text you as well?</span>
            </li>
            <li style="text-align: justify;">
              <span class="u-custom-font" style="font-family: Poppins;">Is it likely that a Nigerian prince left you a million dollars in his will?</span>
            </li>
            <li style="text-align: justify;">
              <span class="u-custom-font" style="font-family: Poppins;">Would the bank ring up asking for your account details? In fact, many banks note when they send emails to their customers or talk to them on the phone. So double check if you’re not sure.</span>
            </li>
          </ul>
          <h5 style="text-align: justify;">
            <span class="u-custom-font" style="font-family: Poppins;">Don't go too fast</span>
          </h5>
          <p style="text-align: justify;">
            <span class="u-custom-font" style="font-family: Poppins;">Be particularly wary when you feel a sense of urgency coming into a conversation. This is a standard way for malicious actors to stop their targets thinking the issue through. If you're feeling pressured, slow the whole thing down. Say you need time to get the information, you need to ask your manager, you don't have the right details with you right now — anything to slow things down and give yourself time to think.</span>
          </p>
          <p style="text-align: justify;">
            <span class="u-custom-font" style="font-family: Poppins;">Most of the time, social engineers won't push their luck if they realize they've lost the advantage of surprise.</span>

          <h4 id="isPasted" style="text-align: justify;">
            <span class="u-custom-font" style="font-family: Poppins;">Secure your devices</span>
          </h4>
          <p style="text-align: justify;">
            <span class="u-custom-font" style="font-family: Poppins;">It's also important to secure devices so that a social engineering attack, even if successful, is limited in what it can achieve. The basic principles are the same, whether it's a smartphone, a basic home network or a major enterprise system.</span>
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li style="text-align: justify;">
              <span class="u-custom-font" style="font-family: Poppins;">Keep your anti-malware and anti-virus software up to date. This can help prevent malware that comes through phishing emails from installing itself. Use a package like Kaspersky's Antivirus to keep your network and data secure.</span>
            </li>
            <li style="text-align: justify;">
              <span class="u-custom-font" style="font-family: Poppins;">Keep software and firmware regularly updated, particularly security patches.</span>
            </li>
            <li style="text-align: justify;">
              <span class="u-custom-font" style="font-family: Poppins;">Don't run your phone rooted, or your network or PC in administrator mode. Even if a social engineering attack gets your user password for your 'user' account, it won't let them reconfigure your system or install software on it.</span>
            </li>
            <li style="text-align: justify;">
              <span class="u-custom-font" style="font-family: Poppins;">Don't use the same password for different accounts.&nbsp;If a social engineering attack gets the password for your social media account, you don't want them to be able to unlock all of your other accounts too.</span>
            </li>
            <li style="text-align: justify;">
              <span class="u-custom-font" style="font-family: Poppins;">For critical accounts, use two-factor authentication&nbsp;so that just having your password isn't enough to access the account. That might involve voice recognition, use of a security device, fingerprinting, or SMS confirmation codes.</span>
            </li>
            <li style="text-align: justify;">
              <span class="u-custom-font" style="font-family: Poppins;">If you just gave away your password to an account&nbsp;and think you may have been 'engineered', change the password straight away.</span>
            </li>
            <li style="text-align: justify;">
              <span class="u-custom-font" style="font-family: Poppins;">Keep yourself informed about new cybersecurity risks by becoming a regular reader of our Resource Center. You'll then know all about new methods of attack as they emerge, making you much less likely to become a victim.</span>
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p style="text-align: justify;">
            <span class="u-custom-font" style="font-family: Poppins;">Think about your digital footprint</span>
          </p>
          <p style="text-align: justify;">
            <span class="u-custom-font" style="font-family: Poppins;">You might also want to give some thought to your digital footprint. Over-sharing personal information online, such as through social media, can help attackers. For instance, many banks have 'name of your first pet' as a possible security question — did you share that on Facebook? If so, you could be vulnerable! In addition, some social engineering attacks will try to gain credibility by referring to recent events you may have shared on social networks.</span>
          </p>
          <p style="text-align: justify;">
            <span class="u-custom-font" style="font-family: Poppins;">We recommend you turn your social media settings to 'friends only' and be careful what you share. You don't need to be paranoid, just be careful.</span>
          </p>
          <p style="text-align: justify;">
            <span class="u-custom-font" style="font-family: Poppins;">Think about other aspects of your life that you share online. If you have an online resumé, for instance, you should consider redacting your address, phone number and date of birth - all useful information for anyone planning a social engineering attack. While some social engineering attacks don't engage the victim deeply, others are meticulously prepared - give these criminals less information to work with.</span>
          </p>
          <p style="text-align: justify;">
            <span class="u-custom-font" style="font-family: Poppins;">Social engineering is very dangerous because it takes perfectly normal situations and manipulates them for malicious ends. However, by being fully aware of how it works, and taking basic precautions, you'll be far less likely to become a victim of social engineering.</span>
